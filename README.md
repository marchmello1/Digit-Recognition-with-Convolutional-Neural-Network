MNIST Digit Recognition with Convolutional Neural Network

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset for digit recognition.

## Overview
The script uses TensorFlow and Keras to implement a CNN model for recognizing hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset. It performs the following steps:

1. Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
2. Define a CNN model architecture.
3. Compile the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer.
4. Train the model on the training data.
5. Evaluate the model on the test data.
6. Make predictions on test images and display them.

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

2. Run the script using the following command:

## Results
The script will train the CNN model on the MNIST dataset and display the test accuracy achieved by the model. It will also show a visualization of some test images along with their predicted labels.

## Further Improvements
Feel free to experiment with the code and make improvements. Some possible areas for enhancement include:
- Modifying the CNN architecture by adding more convolutional and pooling layers.
- Adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate, dropout rate, and batch size.
- Trying different optimization algorithms or loss functions.
- Augmenting the training data for better generalization.
